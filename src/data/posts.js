    title: "Can AI Friends Cure Loneliness? Why I’m Skeptical.",
    content: `Mark Zuckerberg’s push for AI “friends” to combat loneliness is both fascinating and troubling. On one hand, I can see how this could be implemented — an AI that remembers your preferences, responds with empathy, and is always available could offer real comfort, especially for people who are isolated.\n
But here’s the issue: AI can simulate conversation, not true connection. Real friendships are built on vulnerability, effort, and mutual growth — things AI can’t genuinely replicate.\n
There’s also a risk that overreliance on artificial companionship could make people more detached from reality, weakening their ability to build or maintain real relationships.\n
Loneliness is a human issue, and while technology can support connection, it shouldn’t pretend to be the connection itself.\n
In short: AI friends might help in some cases, but they’re no substitute for being known, understood, and loved by real people.`,

    title: "Harvard, Trump, and Global Perception: A Deeper Issue",
    content: `Recently, reports surfaced that international students at Harvard were expressing concern over Donald Trump’s potential influence on the university’s global image. For a school known as a symbol of elite American education, this tension reflects something bigger than politics — it's about how institutions project values globally.\n
While some see this as an overreaction, others argue that the Trump brand — often associated with nationalism and polarization — clashes with Harvard’s reputation for academic freedom and global diversity.\n
I see both sides. On one hand, universities should be open to a spectrum of views, including conservative ones. But international students are right to care how their degree — and by extension, their future — is perceived abroad.\n
This isn't just about Trump or Harvard. It’s about how leadership, even symbolic, affects the credibility of institutions that claim to stand for knowledge, openness, and global cooperation.`,

    title: "The Knicks Should’ve Won — But the Pacers Clearly Summoned Spirits",
    content: `Let’s be honest the Knicks were the better team on paper. They had the momentum, the grit, and Jalen Brunson on a historic tear. But somehow, the Pacers summoned forces beyond basketball to pull off that win.\n
I mean, how else do you explain TJ McConnell suddenly playing like an elite floor general possessed by the spirit of John Stockton? Or how Obi Toppin yes, the *former* Knick  teleported into the paint like he had unfinished business with the timeline?\n
The Knicks played tough. OG was locking down the perimeter, Josh Hart was everywhere, and Brunson was just being Brunson until he mysteriously started limping and vanishing from plays. Coincidence? Or did the Pacers offer a sacrifice?\n
This wasn’t basketball. It was a séance. Rick Carlisle might’ve drawn up plays, but someone else was pulling the strings from the shadow realm. And until the Knicks figure out how to break the curse maybe with a sage stick or a Spike Lee exorcism the Pacers' magic might just keep working.`,
