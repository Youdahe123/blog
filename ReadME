🎨 Frontend (Client-Side)
	•	Purpose: Displays blog posts, lets users read/create/edit posts
	•	Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue, or plain)
	•	Pages:
	•	Home page → list of blog posts
	•	Post detail page → full content
	•	Admin/Create page → form to write or edit posts
	•	API Requests: Uses fetch() or Axios to call the backend

🔧 Backend (Server/API Layer)
	•	Purpose: Handles business logic, routes, and database interaction
	•	Tools: Node.js + Express (or Flask, Django, etc.)
	•	Routes:
	•	GET /posts → fetch all posts
	•	GET /posts/:id → fetch single post
	•	POST /posts → create a new post
	•	PUT /posts/:id → update post
	•	DELETE /posts/:id → delete post
	•	Handles: Authentication (if needed), input validation, error handling

⸻

💾 Database (Data Layer)
	•	Purpose: Stores blog posts and (optional) user data
	•	Tools: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite
	•	Tables/Collections:
	•	posts → id, title, content, author, date
	•	users (optional) → id, username, email, password

⸻

🚀 Flow Example (Creating a Post):
	1.	User fills form on frontend → hits POST /posts
	2.	Backend receives it, validates, saves to DB
	3.	Backend responds with success
	4.	Frontend shows the new post in the list

🎨  Nice-to-Have UI Extras (Still Simple)
	•	🧭 Navbar with links: Home | New Post
	•	🗓️ Date shown on each post
	•	🧾 Form validation: title & content required
