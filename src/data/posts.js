        title: "Can AI Friends Cure Loneliness? Why I’m Skeptical.",
        content: `Mark Zuckerberg’s push for AI “friends” to combat loneliness is both fascinating and troubling. On one hand, I can see how this could be implemented — an AI that remembers your preferences, responds with empathy, and is always available could offer real comfort, especially for people who are isolated.\n
But here’s the issue: AI can simulate conversation, not true connection. Real friendships are built on vulnerability, effort, and mutual growth — things AI can’t genuinely replicate.\n
There’s also a risk that overreliance on artificial companionship could make people more detached from reality, weakening their ability to build or maintain real relationships.\n
Loneliness is a human issue, and while technology can support connection, it shouldn’t pretend to be the connection itself.\n
In short: AI friends might help in some cases, but they’re no substitute for being known, understood, and loved by real people.`,

        title: "Harvard, Trump, and Global Perception: A Deeper Issue",
        content: `Recently, reports surfaced that international students at Harvard were expressing concern over Donald Trump’s potential influence on the university’s global image. For a school known as a symbol of elite American education, this tension reflects something bigger than politics — it's about how institutions project values globally.\n
While some see this as an overreaction, others argue that the Trump brand — often associated with nationalism and polarization — clashes with Harvard’s reputation for academic freedom and global diversity.\n
I see both sides. On one hand, universities should be open to a spectrum of views, including conservative ones. But international students are right to care how their degree — and by extension, their future — is perceived abroad.\n
This isn't just about Trump or Harvard. It’s about how leadership, even symbolic, affects the credibility of institutions that claim to stand for knowledge, openness, and global cooperation.`,
